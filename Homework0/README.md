# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I believe that ungrading has the potential to be really beneficial for a lot of students, so about 50% percent of me believes it's a good thing, but the other 50% is a little worried because it almost seems more stressful giving yourself a grade, also because I kind of like getting grades because its a quantifiable way to show I am improving. So overall, I am mixed.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I believe that it is hard for me to know truly how I feel about it until I complete my first assignment. I am sure the feedback is very detailed, but if it isn't, then I am worried about how well I actually am performing. I also find it stressful that if I grade myself too highly, then I will get an academic integrity violation. But hopefully once I get used to the feedback, I will become more confident in what grade I truly deserve.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
To be honest, a 4.5. I am confident I can learn most things as long as I am tought them well, and from what I've heard, you learn nearly everything here from scratch, including HTML which I am very glad to hear of. I will try my best to put in the work so I can learn this material very well, as well as making cool websites to make my portfolio look nice on a resume.
